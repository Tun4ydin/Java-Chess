# Java-Chess
Chess App using Java

This is my first Java Project.
I want to clarify that Im not a chass player.  This project is something that interested me on how will chess rules transform as digital program. 
Expect a lot of things outside of the rules of chess. I will try to fix it and re upload a better version on a later date. As of now think of it like a more punishing chess game :D.

This project is an implemantation of Chess using Java Programming Language

How does this work:
-The controls and rules are mostly same as chess.
-Drag and drop with your mouse to mkae a valid move.
-The game will stop the executable if any side wins or there is a draw
-Tha game will NOT close if a players turn gets skipped with the current buggy state and the other player captures the oppositions king.

Have fun.

Make sure the resource folder and the java classes are in the same folder or the images would not be loaded

The game is very buggy. When the checked side makes a move the turn gets skipped to the opponent.
For pawn promotion you have to Type (ex. 'Q' or 'q' for Queen) to the console to promote to the desired piece.
The program will quit when there is a winner or a stalemate, you can wiev the results on the console of the program.
En Passant does not work.
If the player makes a move off the grid shown on the display, the current players move will get skipped.

Even though there are GUI or some preventive structures for the buggy sides in the code. I was having problems fixing them so they will stay unused until I update this repository. If you encounter another bug that is not listed here feel free topoint it out. I want to improve my ability to adhere feedbacks from actual users too.
