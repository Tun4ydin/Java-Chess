The game is very buggy. When the checked side makes a move the turn gets skipped to the opponent.
For pawn promotion you have to Type (ex. 'Q' or 'q' for Queen) to the console to promote to the desired piece.
The program will quit when there is a winner or a stalemate, you can wiev the results on the console of the program.

Even though there are GUI or some preventive structures for the buggy sides in the code. I was having problems fixing them so they will stay unused until I update this repository. If you encounter another bug that is not listed here feel free topoint it out. I want to improve my ability to adhere feedbacks from actual users too.
